What is the Recorder?

With the help of the Recorder, we can capture a set of on-screen actions when working with an application. The tool will automatically translate them into StudioX activities, for faster development. We can also configure the activities directly while using the Recorder.

How do I use it?

You will find the Recorder in the StudioX ribbon menu. When you click on its icon, the tool will start automatically.

Recording UI activities in action

For example, in an organisation, one of your weekly tasks is to get the transaction numbers of the operations documented in a spreadsheet. To build the automation, we will use the spreadsheet provided below.

To perform their task, they use the Double UI application, where they enter the information from the spreadsheet. The application generates the numbers, which the employee must then retrieve to the same spreadsheet, in a dedicated column.

In this lesson, you will record the steps the employee performs for this task with the help of the Recorder, exploring the features of the tool.

In developing the automation you will use the following input files, websites and apps:

The Double UI App - this is the dummy bank teller app that we will use to get the transaction numbers.
Automation UI - Input File - this is the spreadsheet we will be working with, it contains information about the transactions and needs to be populated with the transaction numbers.
